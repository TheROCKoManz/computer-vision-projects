All--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
---> Need to look for how to clear GPU Cache, and idle tasks before loading process on GPU
---> Also need to find how to clear GPU cache after complete running of task

Facial Recognition-----------------------------------------------------------------------

FTP Loading slow as Model-file is 500MB in size
Need to keep cache model which would be replaced with newer model on demand

Add FTP to training pipeline too

Facial Features--------------------------------------------------------------------------
---Need to find Feature extraction algorithms that can work on real-time.
---Input: Numpy Vector of Image.
---Output: Dictionary of all features
            result = {
                        'age': age,
                        'gender': gender,
                        'emotion': emotion,
                        'race': race,
                      }

OCR--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
---Need Data
---Create OCR Pipeline

Crowd Analysis---------------------------------------------------------------------------
---Need Data
---Look for Algorithms in use
---Create Pipeline
---List out features to get from crowd analysis
